# SndBankDumper

A simple python script to dump `sound bank` assets from `MW6` with `Cordycep`.

This tool is just for people looking for the source name of hash.

## Features
* Export `sound bank` asset and `sound bank transient` asset respectively.

* Some export settings can be specified in the `config.py` file.

* Automatically retrieve the string table in the game to fill in the sound alias hash name.

* Can import sound asset names from the hash table in `wni/fnv1a_xsounds.csv`.

* The asset name list of sound bank and sound can be filled in the file `assettable.py`.
